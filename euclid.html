	  <p>
	    <b>Axioms </b> or <b>postulates</b> , these are just an assumptions which are obviously universal truth but they are not proved .<br />
		<b>Theorems </b> these are the statements that are proved , using definition , axioms , previously proved statement .<br /><br />
		<strong>Five Euclid's Postulate are -</strong><br /><br />
		<b> Postulate 1 : </b> A straight line may be drawn from any one point to any other point .<br />
		<b> Postulate 2 : </b> A terminated line can be produced indefinetly .<br />
		<b> Postulate 3 : </b> A circle can be drawn from any radius .<br />
		<b> Postulate 4 : </b> A right angles are equal to one another  .<br />
		<b> Postulate 5 : </b> If a straight line falling on two straight lines makes the interior angles on the same side 
		of it taken	together less than two right angles,then  the two straight lines,if produced indefinitely ,meet on the 
		same side on which the sum of angles is less than two right angles..<br /><br /><br />
		<strong>Seven Euclid's Axioms are -</strong><br /><br />
		<b> Axiom 1 : </b> Things which are equal to the same thing are equal to one another .<br />
		<b> Axiom 2 : </b> If equals are added to the equals , the wholes are equal .<br />
		<b> Axiom 3 : </b> If equals are substracted from equals , the remainders the equal .<br />
		<b> Axiom 4 : </b> Things which coincide  with one another are equal to one another .<br />
		<b> Axiom 5 : </b> The whole is greater than the part .<br />
		<b> Axiom 6 : </b> Thigs which are double of the same things are equal to one another .<br />
		<b> Axiom 7 : </b> Things which are halves of the same things are equal to one another.<br /><br /><br />
		<b>Two Equivalent Versions of Euclid's Fifth Postulate are : </b><br /><br />
		<b>(i) </b> For every line l and for every point P not lying on l , there exists a unique line m passing through P and parallel to l .<br />
		<b>(ii) </b> Two distinct intersecting lines can not be parallel to the same line .<br /><br />
		<b>Non-Euclidean Geometries : </b> All the attempts to prove Euclid fifth Postulate using the first four postulates 
		failed . But they led to the discovery of several other geometries , called non-Euclidean Geometries <br />
