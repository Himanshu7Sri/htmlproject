	     <b>Example 1. </b> An observer 1.5 m tall is 28.5 m away from a chimney . the angle of elevation of the top of the chimney from 
		 the eyes is 45&deg; . what is the height of the chimney ? <br />
         <b>Solution : </b>	 let height of the chimney is x <br />
		 distance between chimney and the boy is ( d ) 28.5 m <br />
		 angle of elevation is 45&deg;<br />
		 height of the boy is 1.5<br /><br />
		 tan 45&deg; = ( x - 1.5 ) / d<br />
		 1 = ( x - 1.5 ) / 28.5<br />
		 x - 1.5 = 28.5 <br />
		 x = 28.5 + 1.5 <br />
		 x = 30 m<br /><br /><br />
		 <b>Example 1. </b> From a point on a bridge across the river , the angle of depression of the bank of opposite sides of the river are 
		 30&deg; and 45&deg; , respectively . if the bridge is at the height of 3 m from the bank , find the width of the river . <br />
		 <b>Solution : </b>	 let width of the river is x <br />
		 height ( h ) 3 m <br />
		 angle of depression is 30&deg; and 45&deg;<br /><br />
		 tan 30&deg; = h / AD<br />
		 1 / &radic;3 = 3 / AD<br />
		 AD = 3&radic;3 m <br />
		 now , for calculating the next half width<br />
		 tan 45&deg; = h / BD<br />
		 1 = 3 / BD<br />
		 BD = 3 m <br />
		 <br /> Total width of the river is x = AD + BD <br />
		  x = 3&radic;3 m + 3 m<br />
		  x = 3( 3&radic; + 1 )m <br /><br />
