		   <strong>Natural Number -></strong> Counting numbers are known as natural number .<br />  
<strong>Example -</strong> 1 , 2 , 3 , . . . . . . . , ∞ <br /><br />
<strong>Whole Number -></strong> counting number along with zero are known as whole number .<br />
<strong>Example -</strong>  0 , 1 , 2 , 3 , . . . . . . , ∞ <br /><br />
<strong>Integer -></strong> Natural number along with 0 and negative natural number are known as integer .<br />
<strong>Example -</strong>  -∞ , . . . . . , -2 , -1 , 0 , 1 , 2 , . . . . . . , ∞<br />
<strong>Note -</strong>  Every whole number and natural number is an integer but vice versa is not true .<br /><br />
<strong>Rational Number -></strong> All those numbers are rational number which can be written in the form of  p/q  , where  q ≠ 0 .<br />
<strong>Example -</strong> 0 is rational number as  0/1  .<br />
<strong>Note -</strong>  Every whole number , natural number and integers are rational number  .<br /><br />
<strong>Equivalent Rational Number -></strong>  Rational number after solving the values become same .<br />
<strong>Example -</strong>    15/30 = 1/2   &  144/288 = 1/2      both are equivalent rational number because after solving  both values are 1/2 .<br /><br /><br />
<strong>Real Number -></strong> any number what you can think and that does not contains iota ( i ) are known as real number .<br />
<strong>Example -</strong>  0 , -1 , &radic;2 , &radic;3 , 0.66666.. , 0.101101110... , 5/7 . . . . .  <br /><br />
