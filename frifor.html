	 <center><h2>Frictional Force</h2></center>
	 <p>
	  Friction is a force that resisit the relative motion of solid surface , fluid layer sliding against each other . <br /><br />

	  <b>let us understand what exactly friction is - </b><br /><br />
	  as we know some <b>Meteors</b> will comes near to earth and burn out this is only because of frictional force . meteors comes to earth
	  at very high speed so they face huge frictional force in atmosphere and they start burning and before reaching to the earth they disappear
	  . this is all because of friction and is there were no friction then they fall into earth and they harm us and if huge size of meteors
	  collide with earth then earth may disappear into <b>Galaxy</b> .<br /><br /> 
	  <b><i>If there is no friction in real life than - </i></b><br />
	  <b>1. </b> you can not hold anything in your hand . <br />
	  <b>2. </b> we can not walk or play this can be done only because of frictional force . <br />
	  <b>3. </b> you can't fasten ( tie ) anything with rope as it is useless . <br />
	  <b>4. </b> if you push a box then it will continuously move . <br /><br />

	  <b><i>Remark - </i></b> Frictional force doesn't depend upon the area of body of contact , but depend on how hard the two bodies are
	  pressing against each other and the type of surface  . it act opposite to the direction of motion of a body . <br /><br />
	  <b>Coefficient of friction - </b> A coefficient of friction is a value that shows the relationship between the force of friction 
	  between two objects and the normal reaction between the objects that are involved . it can be represented as <b>&mu; </b>. <br />
	  <center><h3><i>f</i> = &mu;<i>N</i></h3></center><br />
	  <i> N </i> is the normal force . <br /><br />
	  <b> Example - </b> A block is moving with some velocity . if mass of the block is 5 kg and coefficient of friction is 0.4 , find out the 
	   frictional force acting on the body (take g = 10). <br />

	   <b>Solution - </b>  <i>f</i> = &mu;<i>N</i><br/>
            	   <i>f</i> = &mu; x mg <br />
				   <i>f</i> = 0.4 x 5 x 10<br />
				   <i>f</i> = 20 N <br /><br />
	  <b>Types of Frictional force - </b><br />
	  <b>1. </b> Static friction <br />
	  <b>2. </b> Sliding friction <br />
	  <b>3. </b> Kinetic friction <br /><br />
	  <b>Static Friction - </b> the friction that exists between a stationary object and the surface on which it's resting. A frictional 
	  force occurs when you try to push an object alongside a surface .<br />
	   <center><strong><i>f<sub>s</sub></i> = &mu;<sub>s</sub><i>N</i></strong></center><br /><br /><br />
	   <b>Kinetic Friction - </b> It is a force that acts between moving surfaces. An object that is being moved over a surface will 
	   experience a force in the opposite direction as its movement. The magnitude of the force depends on the coefficient of kinetic 
	   friction between the two kinds of material . <br />
