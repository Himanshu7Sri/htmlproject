		  <b>Why we need Cartesian Plane ?</b><br />
		  To find the position of an object , to measure the exact distance between any two objects from a given fixed position . the given fixed point are most of the time is origin . <br /><br />

		  <b>X - Axis </b> - The Horizontal line in the cartesian plane is known as X - axis it is also known as <b>abscissa</b> . <br />
		  <b>Y - Axis </b> - The Vertical line in the cartesian plane is known as Y - axis it is also known as <b>Ordinate</b> . <br />
		  <b>Origin </b> - The fixed point in the cartesian plane is known as <b>Origin</b> . it is zero distance from both the abscissa and ordinate so , it's co-ordinate is ( 0 , 0 ) <br />
		  <b>Co-ordinates </b> -  it is the point in the form of ( x , y ) which tell us how far we are from origin . <b>abscissa</b> . <br />
