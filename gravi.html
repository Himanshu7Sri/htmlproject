	 <p>
	  <b>Johannes Kepler </b> ( 1571 - 1630 ) , he studied the planatary motion in great detail . he formulated his finding as his three laws - <br />
	  <b><i>Kepler's First Law </i></b> - All planets move in an elliptical path with the sun at a focus .<br /><br />
	  <b><i>Kepler's Second Law </i></b> - The radius vector from the sun to thr planet sweeps equal area in equal interval of time .<br /><br />
	  <b><i>Kepler's Third Law </i></b> - The square of the time period of a planet is proportional to the cube of the semimajor axis of the 
	  ellipse .<br /><br />

	  The force of gravitation on object very near to earth is given by <b>mg</b> . <br /><br />
	  <b>The bodies which are far apart from the earth we use universal law of gravitational force .</b> <br /><br />
	  It states that a particle attracts every other particle in the universe using a force that is directly proportional to the product of 
	  their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between their them .<br /><br />
	  <img src="grav1.png"><br />
	  As shown in the given figure there is a body of mass m<sub>1</sub> and another body of mass m<sub>2</sub> which is somewhere else in the world they feel 
	  a force of attrection towards each other with some force F<sub>1</sub> and F<sub>2</sub> respectively but both the forces are equal in magnitude . <br /><br />
	 <b>Question - </b> Figure out that by how much force the sun and the earth attrects each other if mass of earth is 5.98 × 10<sup>24</sup>K and mass of the 
	 sun is 1.99 × 10<sup>30</sup> K and the distance between them is  1.50 × 10<sup>11</sup> m . <br />

	 <b>Solution - </b> <br />
	 <img src="q2.png"> <br /><br />
	 <b>Escape Velocity - </b> the lowest velocity in which a body must have in order to escape the gravitational attraction of a particular planet or other object.<br /><br />
