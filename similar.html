	  <p>
	      similarity of a triangle is a concept in which when two triangles are similar than definately it follows these two rules -<br />
		  <b>1. </b> Corresponding angle of both the triangles are equal .<br />
		  <b>2. </b> Corresponding sides are in the same ratio  .<br /><br />
		  <b>Equiangular Triangles - </b> if the corresponding angles of the two triangle are equal , known as equiangular triangle .<br /><br />

		  The ratio of any two corresponding sides in two equiangular triangles is always the same.<br /><br />
		  <b>Theorem 1 : </b> if a line drawn parallel to the one side of a triangle , intersect the other two side in distinct points 
		  , the other two sides are divided in the same ratio .<br />
		  <b>Proof : </b><br /><br />

		  <b>Theorem 2 : </b> if a line is divided the two sides of a triangle in the same ratio the the line is parallel to the third side of the triangle . <br />
		  <b>Proof : </b><br /><br />
