	 <center><h2>Introduction to Heron's Formula </h2></center>
	  <p>
	   
        Heron was born in about 10AD possibly in Alexandria in Ezypt. He worked in applied mathematics . His work on 
		mathematical and physical subject are so numerous and varied that he is considered to be an encyclopedic writer
		in these field . his geometrical works deal largely with problems on mensuration written three books. Book 1 deals with 
		the area of squares , rectangle , triangle , various other specialised quadrilaterals , the regular polygons , circle ,
		surface area of	cone , cylinders , spheres etc .<br /><br />
		If we want to calculate the area of right angled triangle so we'll easily calculate by using formula <br /><br />
		  <strong>Area of Triangle = 1/2 x base x height</strong><br /><br />
		<b>Here we will discuss about the famous formula which Heron has derived for the area of a triangle in terms of its three sides .</b><br /><br />
		<b>Area of Triangle = &radic;( s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c) )</b><br /><br />
		where a , b , c are the sides of triangle and s = semi-parameter i.e. half of the parimeter of the triangle <br />
		 <b>s = ( a + b + c ) / 2 ;</b>
