	  <p>
	     Trigonometry is very wide concept in mathematics which deals with the sides and angles in Right angled triagle .<br /><br />
		 <b>Trigonometry : </b> it is the relationship between the angle and sides of a triangle .<br />
         <b>Trigonometric Ratio : </b> it is the ratios of the sides of a Right angle triangle with respect to the angle . we'll study it as next topic . <br />		 
		 <b>Trigonometric Identities : </b> It is equalities that involves trigonometric function and are true for every single value of 
		 the occurring variables where sides of the equality are defined. <br /><br />

		 let A be the height of the wall<br /> let B be the distance from where this boy will throw the stone<br />
         if we know the value of A & B then we get  -<br />
         at how much angle he throw the stone .<br />
         how much distance stone covers when it reaches at the top of the house .<br /><br />
         all by the help of trigonometric ratios
