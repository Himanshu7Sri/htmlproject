	 <center><h2>Introduction to Surface Area and Volume</h2></center>
	  <p>
	     Suppose , there was a cuboidal shape box on my roof and if it was raining yesterday night and the box is completely filled with water
		 and if i need to know how much water is there in the box so , i need to calculate the volume of that box that tells me how much water
		 is there in the box <br /><br />
		 length of the box = L<br />
		 breadth or width of the box = B<br />
		 height of the box = H <br /><br />
		 Volume of the box = L x B x H<br /><br /><br />
		 and suppose if i want to paint this box from all of its outer surface so , i need to calculate the total surface area of the box i.e.<br /><br />
         length of the box = L<br />
		 breadth or width of the box = B<br />
		 height of the box = H <br /><br />
		 Total surface area of the box = 2( L.B + B.H + H.L )<br /><br /><br />
         suppose you are in a room and you have a contract to paint that room so you need to calculate the area of of the four wall and area
		 of the top most wall that is <br />
         length of the wall = L <br />
		 width of the wall = B <br />
		 height of the wall = H <br /><br />
		 Area that needs to be painted = 2( B.H + H.L ) + L.B <br /><br /><br />
