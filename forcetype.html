	 <p>
	 <b>Force</b> In the second law of newton , newton gave the definition of force <br /><br />
	 <b> Acceleration - </b> Rate of change of velocity is known as acceleration .<br /><br />
	 <b> Retardation - </b> Negative acceleration ( acceleration is happening but in opposite direction ) is known as retardation . it is also
	 known as deceleration .<br /><br />
	 <b> Newton's Second Law - </b> the vector sum of the forces F on an object is equal to the mass m ( it is suppose that mass of that object is constant )
	 of that object multiplied by the acceleration a of the object: F = ma .<br /><br />

	 <b>Momentum - </b> Product of mass and velocity is known as momentum .<br />
	 <b>Force</b> can also be defined or calculated as rate of change of momentum is known as Force .<br />
	 F = <i>dP/dt</i>  = change in momentum / Time<br /><br />
	 <img src="chmom.png"><br /><br />
	 during change in momentum there can be two possibility - <br />
	  1.  Mass of system remains constant <br />
	  2.  Mass of the system varies<br />
	  <center>In most of cases mass of the system does not varie so we can write the equation as - <br />
	  F = <i>mdv/dt</i><br />
	  <br />if mass and velocity of the system varie then we can use a formula - <br /> 
	  F = <i>change in(mv)/time</i></center><br /><br />
	  <b>Now consider a scenario in which a body is resting on a table . what prevent the body from falling down </b><br />
	  Here , The table exerts a normal force on the body . this is called action force and in return of that the body exerts a downward
	  normal force on the table this is called reaction force . the action and the reaction force act on the body and table .<br /><br />
	  <b>Newton's Third Law - </b> For every action there is equal and opposite reaction . <br /><br />
