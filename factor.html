	 <center><h2>Factorisation</h2></center>
	  <p>
		  since factorise of any polynomial tell us that remainder is 0 at that value of x . we factorise a quadratic 
		  polynomial ( like x<sup>2</sup> + lx + m ) by splitting  the middle term lx as ( ax + bx ) , such that a*b = m
		  so , the result of the factorisation of the polynomial is - <br /><br />
		  <strong> x<sup>2</sup> + lx + m = ( x + a )( x + b )</strong><br /><br />
		  if the quadratic polynomial of the type <b>ax<sup>2</sup> + bx + c</b> , where a &ne; 0 and a , b , c are constant .
		  factorisation of these type of polynomial are of the form -<br /><br />
		  <strong>ax<sup>2</sup> + bx + c = ( px + q )( rx + s )</strong><br /><br />
		  now , ax<sup>2</sup> + bx + c = ( prx<sup>2</sup> + psx + qrx + qs )<br />
		  &nbsp;&nbsp; , ax<sup>2</sup> + bx + c = ( prx<sup>2</sup> + ( ps + qr )x + qs )<br /><br />
		   comparing both side , we get - <br />
          By comparing the coefficient of x<sup>2</sup> , => a = pr <br />
		  By comparing the coefficient of x , => b = ( ps + qr ) <br />
		  By comparing the ( x<sup>0</sup> )constant term , => c = qs <br />
		  these comparison shows us that b is the sum of two numbers ( i.e. ps and qr ) when we multiply those two number we get - <br /> 
		  b = ( ps + qr )  <br /> => multiplication of this number is <br />
		  ps x qr = pr x qs  <br /> => <b> ac</b><br />
		  <strong>At the end summery is this</strong> , we have to write b as the sum of two numbers whose product is ac . <br /><br />
          <b>let us understand this concept with an example - </b><br /><br />
		  <b>Example 1. </b>Find the value of k , if x - 1 is a factor of 4x<sup>3</sup> + 3x<sup>2</sup> - 4x + k.<br />
           <b>Solution - </b><br />
          as x - 1 is the fator of this quadratic equation so x - 1 = 0 => x = 1 is the solution of that equation <br />
          put x = 1 as , <br />
           p(1) = 4.1<sup>3</sup> + 3.1<sup>2</sup> - 4.1 + k<br />
		    => 4 + 3 - 4 + k = 0<br />
			=> k + 3 = 0<br />
			=> k = -3<br /><br /> 
			<b>Example 2. </b>Factorise 6x<sup>2</sup> + 17x + 5 , by splitting the middle term  and by using the factor theorem .<br />
            <b>Solution - </b><br />
            here  a = 6 , b = 17 and c = 5<br />
			splitting b as a sum of two number so that it's product is a*c => 6 * 5 = 30<br />
			
           p(x) = 6x<sup>2</sup> + 17x + 5<br />
		   p(x) = 6x<sup>2</sup> + ( 15 + 2 )x + 5<br />
		   p(x) = 6x<sup>2</sup> + 15x + 2x + 5<br />
		   p(x) = 3x( 2x + 5 ) + 1( 2x + 5 )<br />
		   p(x) = ( 2x + 5 )( 3x + 1 )<br /><br />
